## 15. CR Lifecycle

### 15.1 Design Principle

The pipeline never silently gives up. Every failure, every dead end, every circuit breaker results in a **pause and a decision screen** — the human always chooses what happens next. The pipeline proposes; the human disposes.

### 15.2 State Model

| State | Meaning | Who transitions here | Artifacts on remote |
|-------|---------|---------------------|-------------------|
| **running** | Pipeline is actively executing | Trigger or human resume/retry | Feature branches being built, possibly PRs open |
| **paused** | Pipeline stopped, waiting for human decision | Pipeline (circuit breaker, completion, conflict, wait) | Work in progress preserved |
| **completed** | Released successfully | Human (approved release) | Branches merged (or deleted per release config) |
| **failed** | Human decided to give up on this CR | Human (explicit choice) | Branches and PRs remain until human cleans up |
| **cancelled** | Human chose to stop this CR before it could finish | Human (explicit choice) | Branches and PRs remain until human cleans up |

**The pipeline never transitions directly to `failed`.** It always pauses first. The human sees the failure context — what went wrong, at which stage, for which repo — and chooses:

### 15.3 Failure Decision Screen

When the pipeline pauses due to a problem (circuit breaker, max retries, unresolvable conflict, all providers down), the dashboard presents a **decision screen** with the failure context and available actions:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  CR-142: Add password reset flow                         [PAUSED ⏸]    │

│                                                                         │
│  ┌──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐   │

│  │                                                                  │   │
│  │  [🔄 Retry with instructions]  Redirect the agent with guidance  │   │
│  │  [⏪ Restart from stage]        Pick a stage to go back to       │   │
│  │  [🔁 Retry from scratch]       Fresh start, new branch           │   │
│  │  [🖐 Take over manually]       Work on the branch yourself       │   │
│  │  [❌ Mark as failed]           Give up, open cleanup wizard      │   │
│  │  [🚫 Cancel CR]               Stop entirely, open cleanup wizard │   │
│  └──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘   │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

| Action | What happens |
|--------|-------------|
| **Retry with instructions** | Operator provides guidance text. Pipeline resumes current stage with the instructions injected as highest-priority context. |
| **Restart from stage** | Operator picks a stage (e.g. go back to Behaviour Translation). Everything from that stage onward re-runs. Earlier artifacts preserved. |
| **Retry from scratch** | New pipeline attempt, same CR ID, fresh branch (`ai/cr-{id}-r2`). Previous artifacts remain for reference. |
| **Take over manually** | Human works on the branch directly (via `git clone`). Can mark stages as manually completed in the dashboard when done. When the human clicks "Resume," the pipeline runs a **Sync Node** before the AI continues (see below). |
| **Mark as failed** | CR moves to `failed`. Cleanup wizard opens (see §15.4). Source updated. |
| **Cancel CR** | CR moves to `cancelled`. Cleanup wizard opens (see §15.4). Source updated. |

This same decision screen appears for *every* pause reason — circuit breakers, provider outages, unresolvable merge conflicts, partial multi-repo failures. The context section at the top changes; the action options remain consistent.

Notifications (§17) alert the operator when a CR enters `paused` state, so decision screens don't go unnoticed.

**Resume-with-Validation (Sync Node):** When a human takes over a branch, works on it manually, and then clicks "Resume" in the dashboard, the pipeline does **not** assume the code is valid. The human may have changed anything — added files, refactored code, fixed tests, or introduced new issues. The pipeline runs a Sync Node before the AI continues:

```
Human clicks "Resume"
         │
    ┌────▼───────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
    │  Sync Node                                                  │
    │                                                             │
    │  1. git diff: compare current branch against last           │
    │     AI-known state (the commit when the pipeline paused)    │
    │                                                             │
    │  2. LLM analysis: summarise what the human changed and      │
    │     update Behaviour Specs if the changes affect them       │
    │                                                             │
    │  3. Full test suite: run all tests to establish a clean     │
    │     baseline before the AI continues                        │
    │                                                             │
    │  4. Update PipelineState: inject the diff summary, updated  │
    │     specs, and test results into the pipeline context       │
    └────┬───────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
         │
    Pipeline resumes from the next stage with full awareness
    of what the human did
```

If the test suite fails after the human's changes, the pipeline pauses again (same decision screen) — the human's work introduced a regression, and the operator needs to decide whether to fix it manually or let the AI try.

This handover sync ensures the AI never operates on stale assumptions about the codebase. The diff summary becomes part of the Loop Context (Layer 4) for subsequent agents, so they understand what changed and why.

### 15.4 Cancel / Abort

When an operator explicitly cancels a CR — either from the decision screen or directly from the control room — the CR moves to `cancelled` or `failed`. **The pipeline never auto-deletes artifacts.** Branches and PRs remain on the remote.

The dashboard presents a **cleanup wizard** — a guided form that lets the operator decide what to do with the leftovers:

| Artifact | Options presented | Default |
|----------|------------------|---------|
| Feature branches (`ai/cr-{id}`) | Keep (for reference) / Delete | Keep |
| Open pull requests | Close (with comment) / Leave open / Close and delete branch | Close with comment |
| Source issue status | Report cancelled (or failed) / Leave as-is | Report status |

The operator picks per artifact. The pipeline executes the chosen cleanup. If the operator dismisses the wizard, everything stays — they can come back to it later from the CR detail page.

### 15.5 Source System Changes

The pipeline works from a **snapshot** of the CR taken at intake — it never auto-restarts or auto-updates from a moving target. If the source issue changes while the pipeline is running, the response depends on what changed:

**Substantive changes (auto-pause):** If the CR description or acceptance criteria change, the pipeline is working against stale requirements. Continuing is likely wasteful. The pipeline **auto-pauses** and presents a decision screen:

```

│  └──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘   │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Cancel and re-trigger** is the recommended default for description changes — the pipeline starts a fresh attempt with the updated requirements. But the human always decides. Redirecting the agent is viable for small additions if the pipeline is early enough. Continuing is valid if the change is cosmetic.

**Non-substantive changes (notify only):** Status, priority, assignment, and label changes don't affect what the pipeline is building. These generate a notification but don't pause the pipeline:

| Source event | Pipeline reaction |
|-------------|------------------|
| Issue description / acceptance criteria edited | **Auto-pause** + decision screen (above) |
| Issue closed / resolved externally | **Notify** CR subscribers: "Source issue was closed. Consider cancelling this CR." |
| Issue deleted | **Notify** CR subscribers: "Source issue was deleted. Consider cancelling this CR." |
| Issue re-assigned | **Notify** new assignee: "This issue has an active pipeline run." |
| Issue priority / labels changed | **Notify** CR subscribers. No pipeline effect. |

The pipeline never cancels itself based on source changes — the human always makes that call. Source connectors poll or receive webhooks for these changes and emit notification events. This requires the connector to watch for *updates* on tracked issues, not just new issues.

What counts as "substantive" is configurable per source connector. For Jira: description and acceptance criteria fields. For GitHub Issues: issue body. For the direct API: the `description` and `acceptance_criteria` fields.

### 15.6 Partial Success (Multi-Repo)

A multi-repo CR is **one unit of change**. Each repo's worker runs independently and pushes its own PR. But the release gate only opens when **all repos** have completed — you cannot ship half a feature.

If one repo's worker fails (circuit breaker, unresolvable conflict, etc.), the Controller marks that worker as paused. Other repos' workers continue independently — their work is not wasted. The Controller presents a per-repo status view:

```
CR-142: Add password reset flow
  auth-service:   PR #42 ready ✓
  api-gateway:    PAUSED — circuit breaker at TDD (review loop exceeded 3 iterations)
  email-service:  PR #18 ready ✓
```

The operator can act on the failing repo without affecting successful ones:

| Action | What happens |
|--------|-------------|
| **Redirect the failing repo** | Operator provides new instructions. Controller spawns a new worker for that repo. |
| **Take over the failing repo** | Human works on the branch directly. Marks it done manually. |
| **Retry the failing repo** | Fresh worker for that repo only. Other repos' PRs remain. |
| **Mark CR as failed** | Entire CR fails. Cleanup wizard for all repos' artifacts. |

The key constraint: **the release gate waits for all repos.** A CR either ships completely or not at all. But individual repo workers are independent — a failure in one doesn't block or roll back others.
